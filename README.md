# Python practice

## Welcome to my Python learning repository.   
The idea behind this repository is to practice with Python whilst taking Harvard's [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).

To familiarise with Python I started by using the same exercises I was given by [Boolean](https://boolean.co.uk/) during my Full Stack Development Program but this time I am using Python instead of JavaScript.

Take a look at the [exercises](./exercises) and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolapicchio).
